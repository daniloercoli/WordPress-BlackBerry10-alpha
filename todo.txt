* General
- dashboard.html has a screen menu in it (https://github.com/blackberry/bbUI.js/wiki/Screen-Menus), but it doesn't work. Tested on simulator and Ripple. Swipe down, swipe down!!
- Accessing the Comment detail page seems to break UI
- Need to find a nice way to pass data between pages/screen without using global variable.
- Error dialogs are missing. We are using alert, need to switch to Dialog.
- Loading divs are missing 

* Comments Screen
- Hide/show context menu items in the comments screen depending on the comment's status
- Add the moderating actions to the menu items 

* QuickPhoto
- Uploaded images are empty on the Dev simulator. Guess the canvas trick is not working fine. Need to write a C++ 
component or use AtomPub, since canvas is too memory consumption.

* Low priority
- remove the referecens to EW.LogSystem.debug
- Use Database and not localStorage
- Icons
